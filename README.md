## The fastest way to build a lightning speed Vulkan App!


## **Big Picture**

GPU Script is a high speed app engine and drawing library. Our focus is making the world's fastest cutting edge technology simpler to use.

We simplify workflow with:  

  * Detailed documentation with lots of diagrams
  * Embedded tutorials to get you started quickly
  * Keeping code organized, well named, and well documented
  * Hardware and build testing to avoid pitfalls
  * Templated components from big features to tiny micro details

GPU progamming is an exciting frontier!

We are bringing it together with a set of both high-level and low-level tools.
Best of all it's [MIT License](LICENSE.txt) so you can use it in any project from experiment to commercial hit.

GPU speeds are acclerating at a vastly higher rate than CPU, and a sea change is about to happen in
application development.  Out goal is to help you get to the race track faster.



## **Fast Track To Vulkan**

For those who want to do more with Vulkan:

  * We're passionate members of the Vulkan community
  * We believe it's a growing platform with a great future, backed by the hardware vendors
  * It gets faster with more features every year
  * Vulkan is amazing for cross-platform development.  We got our Ubuntu build ported in 1 day.

We went through all the trial by fire of months to get the triangle up that Vulkan is famous for.
Our hope is to help others get up and running with Vulkan faster.
